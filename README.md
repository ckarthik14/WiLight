# WiLight
*Internet of Things* based project which uses a Web Server built with Flask to control LEDs on a breadboard using Raspberry Pi.

# Raspberry Pi Circuit
1. Copy run.py to your Raspberry Pi.
2. Assemble the circuits such that each LED is connected to a 330 Ohms resistor and the positive end is connected to GPIO pins 18, 23 and 24.
3. Ground all the LED circuits.

# Running the Web Server
1. Run the Web App on your computer by redirecting to the project and entering:

`flask run`

2. Start run.py.
3. Blink Away!
